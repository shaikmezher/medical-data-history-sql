# Medical Data History – SQL Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing real-time medical data using SQL to
extract meaningful insights related to patients, hospital admissions,
diagnoses, doctors, and geographic distribution.

The project simulates a real-world healthcare database and demonstrates
how SQL can be used to solve practical data analysis problems in the
medical domain.

---

## 📂 Dataset Description
The project uses a relational medical database consisting of the
following datasets:

- **Patients** – Personal and medical details of patients
- **Admissions** – Hospital admission and diagnosis records
- **Doctors** – Doctor information and specialties
- **Provinces** – Geographic and location mapping

All datasets are provided in CSV format and stored in the `data/` folder.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- MySQL
- SQL
- Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)

---

## 🔍 Key SQL Concepts Used
- Data filtering and sorting
- Aggregate functions (`COUNT`, `SUM`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`)
- Joins (`INNER JOIN`)
- Subqueries
- Date and string functions
- Conditional logic (`CASE`)
- Data cleaning and updates
